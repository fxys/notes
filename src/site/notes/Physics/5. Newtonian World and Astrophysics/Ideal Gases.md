##### Kinetic Theory of Gases
- The amount of substance is measured in **moles** which indicates the number of atoms or molecules in a sample of a substance.
$$
n = \frac{m}{M}
$$
- **Avogadro's constant** ($N_A$) is the number of atoms of carbon-12 in 12g of carbon-12 which is $6.02\times 10^{23}$ and by definition one mole of a substance is the amount of substance that contains $N_A$ atoms or molecules.
- The **kinetic theory of gases** is a simple model describes the behaviour of atoms or molecules in an ideal gas and the model is based off the following assumptions:
	- The gas contains a very large number of atoms or molecules with identical mass moving in random directions with random speeds.
	- The atoms or molecules of the gas occupy a negligible volume compared to the volume of the gas.
	- The collisions of atoms or molecules with each other and the walls of the container are perfectly elastic.
	- The time of collisions between atoms and molecules is negligible compared to the time between collisions.
	- Electrostatic forces between atoms or molecules are negligible except during collisions.
- **Pressure** in a gas is due to the collisions of gas atoms or molecules with the walls of their container as they undergo a change in momentum.$$
	\begin{aligned}
	let\ \ p_i = mv,\ and\ \ p_f = -mv \\
	\Delta p = p_f - p_i = -mv - mv = -2mv \\
	-F = -\frac{2mv}{\Delta t}
	\end{aligned}$$
	- According to Newton's third law of motion the force experienced by the atom or molecule ($-F$) is equal and opposite to the force the atom exerts on the wall of the container ($F$).
	- When a large number of atoms or molecules collide randomly with the walls of the container they exert the net force, $F$, on a wall and the pressure is given by $p=\frac{F}{A}$.

##### Gas Laws
- **Boyle's law** states that the pressure of a ideal gas is inversely proportional to the volume of the gas when the temperature is constant.
$$
\begin{aligned}
p \propto \frac{1}{V} \\
pV = constant
\end{aligned}
$$
- The **Pressure law** states that the pressure of a ideal gas is directly proportional to the absolute temperature of the gas is the volume is constant.
$$
\begin{aligned}
p \propto T \\
\frac{p}{T} = constant
\end{aligned}
$$
	therefore combining the two laws gives the expression:
	$$\frac{p_1V_1}{T_1} = \frac{p_2V_2}{T_2}$$
- An **ideal gas** obeys the equation of state of an ideal gas at all pressure, volumes and temperatures.
$$
pV = nRT
$$
	where *n* is the number of moles and *R* is the molar gas constant equal to $8.31 J K^{-1} mol^{-1}$.
- To describe typical motion of particles inside an ideal gas the **root mean square speed** is used as an average speed of particles as some particles will have a negative direction which will cancel out positive velocities.
$$
c_{r.m.s} = \sqrt{\overline{c^2}}
$$
$$
\overline{c^2} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=0}^{n} (v_i)^2 
$$
- The Kinetic Theory of Gases equation links particle speed to pressure of a gas.
$$
pV = \frac{1}{3}Nm\overline{c^2}
$$
	where *N* is the number of particles and *m* is the mass of one molecule.
- Particles in a gas move at a range of random speeds and the range of speeds of particles at a given temperature is given by the **Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution** which shows the hotter the gas becomes the greater the range of speeds and the higher the average speed.
- The **Boltzmann constant** (*k*) relates the properties of microscopic particles to their macroscopic properties.
$$
k = \frac{R}{N_A} = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} JK^{-1}
$$
- The Boltzmann constant can be substituted into the equation of state of an ideal gas.
$$
pV = NkT
$$
	where *N* is the number of particles: $N = nN_A$, where *n* is the number of moles.
- **Average kinetic energy** of particles in an ideal gas:
$$
\begin{aligned}
pV = \frac{1}{3}Nm\overline{c^2} = NkT \\
\frac{1}{3}m\overline{c^2} = kT \\
m\overline{c^2} = 3kT,\ \ E_k = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 \\
2E_k = m\overline{c^2} = 3kT \\
E_k = \frac{1}{2}m\overline{c^2} = \frac{3}{2}kT
\end{aligned}
$$
- The average kinetic energy of the particles in the gas are directly proportional to the absolute temperature of the gas.
$$
E_k \propto T
$$
- The assumptions made for an ideal gas include that there is no electrostatic potential energy in an ideal gas therefore all **internal energy** is in the form of kinetic energy of the particles.
$$
\Delta U = E_k = \frac{1}{2}Nm\overline{c^2} = \frac{3}{2}Nk\Delta T
$$
