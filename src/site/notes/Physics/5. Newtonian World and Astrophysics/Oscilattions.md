##### Simple Harmonic Oscillations
- An **oscillation** is the repetitive variation with time of the displacement of an object about its equilibrium position.
- The **displacement** of a wave is the distance of a point on the wave from its equilibrium position.
- The **period** is the time interval for one complete oscillation and it the period remains constant the oscillation is isochronous.
- The **amplitude**, *A*, of an oscillation is the maximum displacement from the equilibrium position.
- **Frequency** is the number of oscillations per seconds and it is measured in hertz.
$$
f = \frac{1}{T}
$$
- The **phase difference** of two waves is a measure of how much a wave is in front or behind another which can be found through relative position of crests or troughs.
- **Angular frequency** is the rate of change of angular displacement or the rate of oscillation. 
$$
\omega = \frac{2\pi}{T} = 2\pi f 
$$
- As oscillation is **simple harmonic motion** if the acceleration, acting in the opposite direction, of an object is directly proportional to its displacement.
$$
a = -\omega^2x
$$
- The negative sign means the acceleration of the object acts in the opposite direction to the displacement to return to object to its equilibrium position.
- An oscillation in simple harmonic motion is an isochronous oscillation so the period is independent of the amplitude.
- The displacement-time graph of a simple harmonic motion oscillation can be described using either a sine or cosine graph.
$$
x = A\sin\omega t\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ x = A\cos\omega t
$$
- The sine graph is relevant for objects that begin oscillating from the equilibrium position and the cosine graph is relevant for objects that begin oscillating from their amplitude position.
- **Velocity** of an object in simple harmonic motion:
$$
v = \pm\omega\sqrt{A^2-x^2}
$$
- An oscillator has a maximum velocity when it is at its equilibrium position, x = 0, and has a greater maximum velocity if the amplitude is greater as it has to travel a greater distance in the same time.
$$
v_{max} = \omega A
$$
- The motion of objects in simple harmonic motion can be represented by graphs against time.

- During simple harmonic motion **energy** is constantly transferred between kinetic energy and potential energy stores and the total energy always remains constant.
- The kinetic energy of an oscillator is at maximum when the displacement is zero and the oscillator is at equilibrium and the potential energy is at a maximum when the displacement equals the amplitude.
- Kinetic energy and potential energy go through two complete cycles during one oscillation.

##### Damping
- **Free oscillation** occur when there is no transfer of energy to the surroundings and only internal forces act on the object to oscillate the object at its resonant frequency.
- **Forced oscillation** occurs when a periodic force does work on the object to sustain oscillations due to energy lost to the surroundings where oscillations occur at the same frequency as the driving frequency.
- All oscillators stop oscillating due to resistive forces that reduce the motion of an oscillator in practice.
- **Damping** is the reduction in energy and amplitude of oscillations due to resistive forces acting on an oscillating system to bring the oscillator to rest at its equilibrium position.

- Types of damping include:
	- **Light damping** when oscillations slowly decrease in energy exponentially with time and amplitude decreases exponentially while frequency remains constant.
	- **Very heavy damping** when an oscillator returns to its equilibrium position slowly without oscillating.
	- **Critical damping** when an oscillator returns to the equilibrium in the shortest possible time without oscillating.
- The **natural frequency** of an oscillating system is the frequency when the system is allowed to oscillate freely.
- **Resonance** is when the driving frequency of a forced oscillation is equal to the natural frequency of the oscillator and when an object resonates the amplitude of the oscillation will increase significantly.
- If an undamped object resonates the amplitude will increase to the point at which the object fails because the energy is transferred from the driver most efficiently at resonance.
- Damping reduces the amplitude of resonance vibrations and the resonant frequency also decreases.
