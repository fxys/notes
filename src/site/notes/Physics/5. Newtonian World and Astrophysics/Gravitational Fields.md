##### Gravitational Fields
- All objects create with mass create a gravitational field around them which affects any other object with mass.
- Gravitational **field lines** are directed towards the centre of mass of a body which are vectors showing the direction of force.
- Gravitational field lines around a **point mass** are radially inwards and the gravitational field strength is different depending on how far a mass is from the centre of the field.
- **Uniform gravitational fields** have field lines parallel and equidistant and therefore the gravitational field strength does not change and the gravitational field close to a surface of a large sphere, such as a planet, is approximately uniform.
- **Gravitational field strength** at a point is the force per unit of mass of an object at that point.
$$
g = \frac{F}{m}
$$
- **Newton's Law of Gravitation**: The attractive gravitational force between two masses is proportional to the product of their mass and inversely proportional to the square of their separation.
$$
F = -\frac{Gm_1m_2}{r^2}
$$
	where *G* is Newton's gravitational constant with the value of $6.67 \times 10^{-11}Nm^2kg^{-2}$ and *r* is the distance between the centre of the two masses.
- The gravitational field strength in a radial field for a point mass can be found using Newton's law of gravitation.
$$
g = -\frac{GM}{r^2}
$$
	where *r* is the radial distance from the point mass, *M*. Therefore the gravitational field strength around a point is directly proportional to the mass and inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the point.

##### Planetary Motion
- **Kepler's laws of planetary motion** describe the motion of planets as well as moons and satellites:
	- **Kepler's first law**: The orbit of a planet is an ellipse, with the sun at one of the two foci.

	- **Kepler's second law**: A line segment joining the Sun to a planet sweeps out equal area in time intervals.
		![Pasted image 20230710144618.png](/img/user/Attachments/Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020230710144618.png)
		- When the time between AB and CD are equal the area of x equals the area of y, therefore planets move faster when they are closer to the sun.
	- **Kepler's third law**: The square of the orbital time period of a planet is proportional to the cube of its average distance from the Sun.
$$
T^2 \propto r^3
$$
- Most planets have a near circular orbit and therefore the gravitational force between the Sun and planet provides the **centripetal force** needed for a planet to remain in orbit.
$$
\begin{aligned}
F_{centripetal} = \frac{mv^2}{r} \\
F_g = \frac{GMm}{r^2} \\
for\ a\ circular\ orbit,\ F_{centripetal} = F_g \\
\frac{mv^2}{r} = \frac{GMm}{r^2} \\
v^2 = \frac{GM}{r} \\
v = \omega r = \frac{2\pi r}{T} \\
(\frac{2\pi r}{T})^2 = \frac{GM}{r} = \frac{4\pi^2r^2}{T^2} \\
T^2 = \frac{4\pi^2r^3}{GM} = (\frac{4\pi^2}{GM})r^3 \\
therefore\ \ T^2 \propto r^3\ \ (Kepler's\ third\ law)
\end{aligned}
$$
- Many satellites follow a **geostationary orbit** in which the satellite:
	- Remains directly above the equator.
	- Orbits earth at the same point above Earth's surface.
	- Moves from west to east in the same direction as the Earth's rotation.
	- Has an orbital time period of 24 hours equal to the Earth's rotational period.
- Geostationary satellites are used for telecommunication transmissions as it means satellite receiver dishes can be fixed.

##### Gravitational Potential
- Gravitational potential, *V*$_g$ at a point in a gravitational field is the work done per unit of mass to move an object to that point from infinity.
- At an infinite distance away from a point the gravitational field strength is zero therefore the gravitational potential is zero.
$$
V_g = -\frac{GM}{r}
$$
- The gravitational potential increases with the distance from the mass because work is done against the gravitational force.
- **Force-distance graphs** show how the gravitational force changes with the distance between the centres of the masses.

	- The force is inversely proportional to the distance as by Newton's law of gravitation.
	- The **area** under a force-distance graph is equal to work done and the area between B and A and the curve represents the work done by the gravitational force to move a mass from distance A to B.
- **Gravitational potential energy** is the work done to move a mass from infinity to a point in a gravitational field.
$$
E = mV_g = -\frac{GMm}{r}
$$
$$
\Delta E = m\Delta V_g
$$
- **Escape velocity** is the minimum speed that will allow an object to escape a gravitational field and this is reached when all of an objects kinetic energy is transferred to gravitational potential energy.
$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{1}{2}mv^2 = \frac{GMm}{r} \\
v = \sqrt{\frac{2GM}{r}}
\end{aligned}
$$
