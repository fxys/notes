##### Temperature
- Thermal energy is always transferred from a high temperature region to a region of lower temperature.
- **Thermal equilibrium**: When two objects in physical contact no longer exchange any thermal energy and reach an equal temperature. 
- To measure temperature, a scale is needed that includes two fixed points at defined temperature and temperature is the measure of direction of energy transfer or the average kinetic energy of the particles.
- The **absolute temperature** scale or thermodynamic temperature scale uses the **triple point of pure water**, at which pure ice, pure water and pure water vapour can coexist at the same temperature and pressure, and **absolute zero** which measures temperature in **kelvin**.
$$
T (K) \approx \theta (\degree C) + 273
$$
- The absolute temperature scale does not depend on the properties of any substance unlike the Celsius scale which depends on the freezing and boiling points of water which change at different pressures.

##### Kinetic Model
- The kinetic theory of matter is a model to explain the properties of the three states of matter where particles are assumed to be small solid spheres.
- **Solids**:
	- Particles are regularly arranged in a lattice structure and held closely together by strong intermolecular forces.
	- Particles vibrate in fixed positions and have low energies relative to liquids and gases.
	- Solids have a fixed shape and volume and are difficult to compress.
	- When a solid is heated, the particles gain energy and vibrate faster and may breakaway from the lattice and move freely as the solid melts into a liquid.
- **Liquids**: 
	- Particles are arranged randomly but held closely by weaker intermolecular forces relative to solids.
	- Particles can flow past each other and have higher kinetic energies compared to solids.
	- Liquids do not have a fixed shape and take the shape of their container however they have a fixed volume and are difficult to compress.
	- When liquids are heated, some particles gain enough kinetic energy to overcome their intermolecular forces and break away from other particles as the liquid evaporates into a gas.
- **Gases**:
	- Particles are far apart due to negligible intermolecular forces between particles.
	- Particles move in random directions at a variety of speeds with high energies and occasionally collide with each other or the walls of their container.
	- Gases do not have a fixed shape and take the shape of their container and do not have a fixed volume and expand to fill their container so they can be compressed.
	- When gases are cooled, the particles lose kinetic energy and move slower and the space between the particles decreases and the particles succumb to their intermolecular forces as the gas condense into a liquid.
- **Brownian motion**: Small particles suspended in a liquid or gas are observed to move around in constant, random motion.
- **Internal energy** is the sum of randomly distributed kinetic and potential energies of atoms or molecules within substance.
- **Absolute zero** (0 K) is the temperature at which molecules in a substance have zero kinetic energy which is lowest temperature possible as it is not possible to remove any more energy from the molecules.
- At absolute zero, the internal energy is not zero as substances still have electrostatic potential energy stored between particles.
- As a substance is heated the internal energy of the substance increases as the average kinetic energy of the molecules increases and the molecules become more spaced out leading to a greater potential energy to overcome the intermolecular forces.
- Internal energy is directly proportional to temperature when it is measured in kelvin so a change in temperature results in a proportional change in internal energy.
$$
\Delta U \propto \Delta T 
$$
- When substance are heated and reach a certain temperature, the kinetic energy of molecules will stop increasing so the temperature remains the same and the energy will go into increasing their electrostatic potential energy instead to overcome their intermolecular forces causing the molecules to move further apart causing a phase change.
- Different states of matter have different electrostatic potential energies:
	- Gases have an electrostatic potential energy of zero as there are negligible forces between molecules.
	- Liquids have an electrostatic potential energy of a small negative value as energy is required to overcome forces between molecules.
	- Solids have an electrostatic potential energy of a large negative value as a high amount of energy is required to overcome forces between molecules.

##### Thermal Properties
- **Specific heat capacity** is the amount of thermal energy required to raise the temperature per unit mass of a substance by 1 $\degree$C or 1 K. 
$$
E = mc\Delta \theta
$$
- If a substance has a low specific heat capacity, it heats up and cools down quickly whereas if a substance has a high specific heat capacity it heats up and cools down slowly.
- **Specific latent heat of fusion** is the thermal energy required to change the state of per unit mass of a substance form solid to liquid with no change in temperature.
- **Specific latent heat of vaporisation** is the energy required to change the state per unit mass of a substance from liquid to gas with no change in temperature.
$$
E = mL
$$
- To find the specific heat capacity of a material:
	- Measure the mass of the amount of material and insulate it, to reduce uncertainty due to dissipation of energy to the surroundings, before connecting it to a heating element and a thermometer,
	- Connect the heating element to a circuit with, voltmeter, ammeter, and battery.
	- Heat the material and record the temperature of it at regular intervals to create a graph of temperature against time.
	- Use the ammeter and voltmeter readings to find the power of the heater and use the gradient (rate of change of temperature), power and mass to find the specific heat capacity.
