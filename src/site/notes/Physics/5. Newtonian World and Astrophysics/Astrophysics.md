##### Stars
- The **universe** is contains everything that exists and is a large collection of galaxies.
- **Galaxies** are clusters of stars and clouds of dust and gas.
- **Solar systems** consist of a star and gravitationally bound objects that orbit the star.
- **Planetary satellites** orbit a planet and include natural satellites like moons and artificial satellites.
- **Comets** are small bodies made up of ice, dust and rock and orbit stars in highly eccentric orbits.
- **Nebulae** are large clouds of dust and gas, mainly hydrogen, often many light years across.
- Stars are formed from nebulae.
	- The gravitational attraction between particles in nebulae cause gravitational collapse and matter moves inwards to form denser regions as gravitational collapse accelerates.
	- The gravitational energy of the particles is converted to thermal energy and the gas becomes warmer.
	- The centre of the cloud becomes a hot and dense **protostar** however for nuclear fusion to begin the core of the protostar needs to have a very high temperature and protostar to overcome electrostatic repulsion between hydrogen nuclei.
	- As the protostar grows it can become hot enough for fusion to start to produce helium to produce a star.
- Stars spend most of their life in the **main sequence period**.
	- The star remains in a stable equilibrium between outwards radiation pressure due to the momentum of photons emitted in nuclear fusion and gravitational collapse inwards.
- Larger stars are hotter and undergo fusion faster using up hydrogen more quickly and therefore larger stars have a shorter main sequence period.
- Evolution of low-mass stars ($0.5\ M_{\odot} - 10\ M_{\odot}$):
	- As hydrogen begins to run out, the inwards gravitational collapse overcomes the outwards radiation pressure due to fusion and the star shrinks.
	- The core of the star collapses leading to an increase in temperature and the pressure in the shell around the core increases to start fusion and fusion stops in the core as there is little hydrogen and the temperature is not high enough.
	- The outer layers of the star expand and cool to form a red giant and the heat generated by the collapsing core provides a high enough temperature to fuse hydrogen in the outer layers.
	- The outer layers are ejected as the star cools as a planetary nebula because as helium burning in the core finishes the core contracts again but is no longer hot enough to fuse heavy elements so the star becomes unstable.
	- The solid core collapses under its own mass leaving a very dense core called a white dwarf which emits some energy but cools down.
- A white dwarf is the remnant of a low mass star where nuclear fusion no longer takes place.
	- Matter is white dwarfs is compressed to a very small volume when the core of a star collapses and the electrons are no longer free to move between energy levels.
	- Electrons are forced to fill the available energy levels and the compression causes electrons to move into higher energy levels and this rush of electrons to find space creates a pressure called the electron degeneracy pressure which results in an outward force.
	- For a low-mass star the outward electron degeneracy pressure balances the inward gravitational force preventing further collapse resulting in a stable white dwarf.
	- The Chandrasekhar limit of a white dwarf is the maximum mass of a stable white dwarf star which is $1.4\ M_{\odot}$ and if the mass exceeds this the electron degeneracy pressure can no longer prevent collapse and a neutron star is formed.
- Evolution of massive stars  ($>10\ M_{\odot}$):
	- As hydrogen begins to run out, the inwards gravitational collapse overcomes the outwards radiation pressure due to fusion and the star shrinks.
	- The core of the star collapses leading to high temperatures to fuse more heavier nuclei to form elements up to iron in the core and fusion of hydrogen in the shell which means the outer layers expand to form a red supergiant.
	- Once an iron core forms the star becomes unstable as fusion reactions stop and the star begins to collapse and the gravitational potential energy transferred during the collapse leadings heating.
	- The force of the stars weight causes protons and electrons to combine to form neutrons releasing large amounts of energy and the outer shell is emitted in an explosive supernova.
	- The supernova generates temperatures and pressures great enough to fuse heavy nuclei to form all heavy elements and the outer layers of the star are ejected into space to form a large planetary nebula.
	- After the supernova explosion, the collapsed core can remain intact as a neutron star but if the mass of the core is greater than $3\ M_{\odot}$ than the core will collapse to create a black hole.
- Neutron stars are extremely dense and some neutron stars, known as pulsars, rotate rapidly emitting bursts of electromagnetic radiation.
- In a black hole the singularity is the theoretical point is the point at which matter is compressed to an infinitely small point.
	- The gravitational field of black holes is strong enough so the escape velocity is greater than the speed of light so photons cannot escape the gravitational point beyond the event horizon.
- A Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram plots luminosity, relative to the sun, of different stars against their temperature and stars are clustered in distinct areas and the luminosity scale is logarithmic while the temperature scale is reversed.

##### Electromagnetic radiation from stars
- Energy levels of electrons come from the Bohr model to the atom where electrons occupy specific orbits around the nucleus in separate shells or energy levels.
- When electrons gain energy they become exited and can move to a higher energy level and energy is released as electrons move to lower energy levels and this is de-excitation.
- The energy released during de-excitation of electrons is released as electromagnetic radiation at a specific frequency.
- The energy of an electron is zero when it is infinitely far away from the nucleus.
- The value of the energy level is equal to the amount of energy required to remove an electron from the energy level and they have negative values as external energy is required to remove the electron.
- An emission line spectrum is produced when an excited electron in an atom moved from a higher to a lower energy level and emits a photon with an energy corresponding to the difference in the energy levels.
	- Each element produces a unique emission line spectrum due to its unique set of energy levels and each line of the emission spectrum corresponds to a different energy level transition within the atom.
- The energy required to move an electron from one energy level to another equals the energy of the absorbed photon.
$$
\Delta E = hf=\frac{hc}{\lambda}
$$
- Stars produce a unique emission line spectrum, which are made up of dark lines on top of a continuous spectrum which is represented by the absorbed wavelengths, which can be used to identify the elements within stars.
- A continues spectrum contains all wavelengths of lights and they are produced by hot and dense sources such as from fusion reactions in the cores of stars,
- An emission line spectrum is produced when electrons transition from a higher to a lower energy level emitting photons resulting in a spectrum containing a set of discrete wavelengths.
- An absorption line spectrum is produced when photons are absorbed and therefore some wavelengths will be missing from the spectrum and there will be dark lines over a continuous spectrum.
- Dispersion is the separation of visible light into a spectrum which can be done through a diffraction grating which is helpful to analyse light from stars to identify its composition.
	- A transmission diffraction grating is a glass slide containing a large number of regularly spaced parallel slits.
- The angles at which the maxima of intensity are produced can be found with the diffraction grating equation.
$$
d\sin(\theta)=n\lambda
$$
	where *d* is the spacing between adjacent slits and *n* is the order of maxima and $\lambda$ is the wavelength of the source.
- A black body radiator is one that absorbs and emits all wavelengths and stars are good approximations of black body radiators.
- **Wien's Displacement Law**: The black body electromagnetic radiation curve, of intensity against wavelength, for different temperatures peaks at a wavelength that is inversely proportional to the temperature.
$$
\lambda_{max} \propto \frac{1}{T}
$$
	where *T* is the absolute surface temperature of the object.
- Wien's law shows that the higher the temperature of a body the shorter the emitted wavelengths will be on average and therefore hotter stars appear blue or white compared to cooler stars that appear yellow or red.
- Luminosity of a star is the total power output of radiation emitted by the star and it can be found using Stefan's Law and it is measured in W.
$$
L=4\pi r^2\sigma T^4
$$
	where $\sigma$ is the Stefan constant equal to $5.67\times \,\, 10^{-8} Wm^{-2}K^{-4}$, *r* is the radius of the star and *T* is the absolute surface temperature of the star.
