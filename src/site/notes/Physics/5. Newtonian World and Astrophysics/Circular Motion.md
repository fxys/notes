##### Kinematics
- Angles can be measured in **radians** where 360$\degree$ is equal to 2$\pi$ radians.
- **Frequency** is the number of complete oscillations per unit of time and **time period** is the time taken for one oscillation.
$$
f = \frac{1}{T}
$$
- One oscillation in circular motion is equal to one complete revolution.
- **Angular velocity** of an object in a circular path is the rate of change of angular displacement which is the change in angle as a body moves in it's circular path and is measured in rad s$^{-1}$.
$$
\omega = \frac{2\pi}{T} = 2\pi f 
$$

##### Centripetal Force
- The **centripetal force** in circular motion is the force perpendicular to an objects velocity so the object continues moving in a circle.
- Objects in circular motion have a constant linear speed which is proportional to the radius if angular velocity remains constant.
$$
v = \omega r
$$
- **Centripetal acceleration** is the acceleration of objects in circular motion which acts towards the centre of the circle or the acceleration of objects towards the centre of a circle.
$$
a = \frac{v^2}{r} = \omega^2r
$$
	therefore
$$
F = \frac{mv^2}{r} = m\omega^2r
$$
