##### Cosmology
- The astronomical unit (au) is the mean distance from the centre of the Earth to the centre of the Sun which is around $1.5\times 10^{11}$m.
- A light-year (ly) is the distance travelled by light in one year which is around $9.5 \times 10^{15}$m.
- The parsec (pc) is the the distance that gives a parallax of 1 arcsecond using the radius of Earth's orbit (1 au) as the baselined of a right-angled triangle which is around $3.1 \times 10^{16}$m.
- Stellar parallax is the apparent shifting in position of a nearby star against a background of distant stars when viewed from different positions of the Earth during Earth's orbit.
$$
\begin{align}
\text{let p = parallax in arcseconds, d = distance to star in pc}  \\
\tan p=\frac{1 \ au}{d} \\
\text{when x is small:} \\
\tan x \approx x \ rad = x \frac{180}{\pi}3600 \ arcseconds \\
p\approx \frac{1\ au}{d} \frac{180}{\pi}3600 \\
\text{for p} =1 \ arcsecond \\
d = \frac{1au}{\frac{\pi}{180} \frac{1}{3600}} \approx \frac{1au}{\tan(1 \ arccsecond)}=1 \ pc \\
\therefore p = \frac{1}{d}
\end{align}

- The parallax equation is not accurate for large distances as the angles involved are too hard to measure accurately.
- **The Cosmological Principle**: The universe is isotropic, homogenous and the laws of physics are universal.
	- Isotropic means that the universe is the same in all directions to every observer.
	- Homogenous means that matter is uniformly distributed and the universe had a uniform density.
- **The Doppler Effect**: When the source of a wave is moving there is an apparent shift in wavelength.
- When a wave source is moving towards an observer the wavefronts will appear squashed and when wave source is moving towards an observer the wavefronts will appear squashed.
- A moving wave source causes the wavelength received by observer to change although the actual wavelength emitted by the source remains the same.
- The Doppler Equation relates the relative speed of the wave source, *v*, and the wave speed, *c*, with the observed wavelength shift and frequency shift when *v* is small compared to *c*.
$$
\frac{\Delta \lambda}{\lambda} \approx \frac{\Delta f}{f} \approx \frac{v}{c}
$$
- **Hubble's Law**: The recessional velocity of a galaxy is proportional to its distance from Earth.
$$
v \propto d \Longrightarrow v\approx H_{0}d
$$
	where $H_0$ is Hubble's constant which is measured in kms$^{-1}$Mpc$^{-1}$ or s$^{-1}$ if the distance from the earth to the object was measured in km.
- The model of an expanding universe is supported by galactic redshift as distant galaxies are moving away from Earth.
- The Big Bang Theory explains the formation of the universe from an infinitely dense, hot and small singularity.
	- As a result of a large explosion, the Big Bang, space and time were created and the universe has been constantly expanding since the point.
- Microwave Background Radiation had been detected in all directions and at a generally uniform temperature of 2.7 K.
	- Microwave Background Radiation provides evidence for the Big Bang which emitted lots of radiation which overtime has been redshifted to the microwave region of the spectrum and has reduced in intensity.
- The Big Bang gave rise to the expansion of space-time, a property which connects the three dimensions of space to a fourth dimension, time.
- Stages in the evolution of the universe:
	- Stage 0: the Big Bang occurred and space and time were created and the universe is an infinitely dense, hot and small singularity.
	- Stage 1 (0-10$^{-35}$s): the universe expands rapidly in the process of inflation and there is no matter, only electromagnetic radiation in the form of high energy gamma photons.
	- Stage 2 (10$^{-35}$-10$^{-6}$s): building block particles come into existence and there is slightly more matter than antimatter.
	- Stage 3 (10$^{-6}-225$s): the universe cools and protons and neutrons begin to from and matter and antimatter collide producing high-energy photons.
	- Stage 4 (225s-1000 years): the universe behaves in the same way as the core of a star and nuclear fusion begins when protons and neutrons fuse to form light nuclei and matter is in plasma form.
	- Stage 5 (1000-3000 years): nuclear fusion ends and electrons are formed.
	- Stage 6 (3000-300000 years): the universe continues to cool and electrons combine with nuclei to form atoms and photons become free to travel through space which become background radiation.
	- Stage 7 (300000 years-present): stars and galaxies begin to form and heavy elements are created from the collapse of stars until we reach the present day, 13.7 billion years after the Big Bang.
- Dark energy is a hypothetical type of energy that permeates the whole universe and opposes the attractive gravitation force between galaxies via the exertion of a negative pressure which accelerates the expansion of the universe.
- Dark matter is matter which cannot be seen and that does not emit or absorb electromagnetic radiation.
