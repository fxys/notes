##### Photons
- Photons are massless fundamental particles which make up all forms of electromagnetic radiation and carry specific amounts of energy.
- Light waves can behave as particles and waves which is called the wave-particle duality.
	- Light interacts with matter as a particle and propagates through space as a wave.
- The energy can be calculates using the Planck's constant, *h*, which is $6.63\times 10^{-34} Js$ and the higher the frequency of electromagnetic radiation, the higher the energy of the photon.
$$
E=hf=\frac{hc}{\lambda}
$$
	where *c* is the speed of light.
- The electronvolt is a unit of energy equal to the energy gained by an electron travelling through a potential difference of 1 V, therefore $1 eV = 1.6 \times 10^{-19}J$.

##### The photoelectric effect
- The photoelectric effect is the phenomena of electrons being emitted, known as photoelectrons, from a surface of a metal when electromagnetic radiation is absorbed.
	- This provides evidence that light is quantised and carried a discrete 'packets' as each electron can only absorb a single photon so only frequencies above of light above a threshold will emit a photoelectron.
- The photoelectric effect can be observed on a gold leaf electroscope:
	- A plate of metal is attached to a gold leaf with a negative charge causing it to be repelled which causes a negative charge to be build up on the plate.
	- UV light is shone onto the metal plate leading to the emission of photoelectrons which causes electrons to be removed and the gold leaf falls backwards as the metals repel less.
	- Observations of the experiment:
		- Placing the UV light closer causes to gold leaf to fall more quickly as the intensity of radiation increases which leads to more photons incident on the leaf.
		- A higher frequency light source does not change how quickly the gold leaf falls as the energy and frequency of the radiation is independent of intensity.
		- A filament light causes no change in the gold leaf's position because the light has a frequency below the threshold frequency of the metal and no photoelectrons are released.
- The number of photoelectrons emitted is equal to the number of photons incident on the surface of a metal as increasing the intensity of radiation increases the number of photons per area incident on the surface.
- The work function is the minimum energy required to release a photoelectron from the surface of a metal.
- As energy is conserved, the energy of an incident photon is equal to the sum of the work function, $\phi$, and the maximum kinetic energy of the photoelectron.
$$
hf =\phi + KE_{max}
$$
- The threshold frequency is the minimum frequency of incident electromagnetic radiation required to emit a photoelectron from the surface of a metal, and it depends on the material and if a photon with the threshold frequency leads to a release of a photoelectron it will have zero kinetic energy.
$$
hf_{0}=\phi
$$
- Increasing the frequency of the incident radiation will lead to the emitted photoelectrons having a higher maximum kinetic energy as the energy of photons is proportional to frequency.
- If the incident photon do not have a high enough frequency, the threshold frequency, and energy to overcome the work function, no photoelectrons are emitted.
- The photoelectric equation can be represented graphically as a graph of maximum kinetic energy against frequency, where the y-intercept is the work function and the x-intercept is the threshold frequency.
- The maximum kinetic energy of photoelectrons is independent of intensity of the incident radiation as increasing the intensity or number of photons striking the metal will not increase the kinetic energy as kinetic energy is only dependant on the frequency.

##### Wave-particle duality
- Electrons can behave as both particles and waves:
	- When electrons are fired at a thin slice of polycrystalline graphite, the electrons pass between the carbon atoms in layers and get diffracted as the gaps are similar to the wavelength of electrons.
	- Electrons also behave as particles as they can be accelerated by high potential differences and can be deflected by magnetic fields.
- The wavelength of a particle is inversely proportional to its momentum and this is the de Broglie equation.
$$
\lambda = \frac{h}{p}
$$
- The de Broglie equation can be applied to all particles however as particles become large their wave properties are harder to observe because they have a greater momentum and therefore a shorter wavelength.
