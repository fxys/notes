##### Charge
- Electric current is the rate of flow of positive charge carriers.
$$
I = \frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta t}
$$
- Charge is a fundamental property of particles and can flow between two oppositely charged conductors, and particles with a charge interact with each other.
- Charge is measured in Coulombs and 1 C is the amount of charge conveyed in 1 s by a current of one 1 A.
- The elementary charge is $e=1.60\times 10^{-19} C$ where the charge of an electron is $-e$ and the charge of a proton is $+e$.
$$
\text{net charge}/Q = \pm ne
$$
	where *n* is the number of charge carriers.
- In metals, the flow of charge is made up by electrons as metals form metallic bonds leaving delocalised electrons that can carry the charge through the structure from the negative side to positive side making metals good conductors.
- In electrolytes, the flow of charge is made up by ions which can either be anions (negatively charged) or cations (positively charged) that flow between electrodes.
- Current is measured using an ammeter which is connected to a circuit in series, so therefore an ammeter should have the lowest possible resistance to reduce the effect on the current to increase accuracy.
- In circuits, conventional current is the flow of positive charge from the positive terminal of the cell to the negative terminal which is opposite to the direction of electron flow from negative to positive.
- **Kirchhoff's First Law**: The sum of the currents entering a junction always equal the sum of the currents leaving the junction because charge is conserved.
$$
\Sigma I_{in}= \Sigma I_{out}
$$
- The mean drift velocity, *v*, of charge carries is the average velocity of charge carriers travelling through a conductor.
$$
I=Anev
$$
	where *n* is the number density of charge carriers and *A* is the cross-sectional area.
- Therefore $v \propto \frac{1}{n}$ so a higher number of charge carriers in a conductor will slow down their speed but increase the current.
- Therefore the narrower the wire, the greater the drift velocity of charge carriers must be in order for the current to be the same.
- The number density of charge carriers, *n*, of a material determines how well the material conducts electricity:
	- Conductors will have a very large value of *n* so there will be many free electrons to carry charge so *n* can be in the range of $10^{28}$.
	- Semiconductors have a conductivity between conductors and insulators so *n* can be range of $10^{10}$
	- Insulators will have a very small value of *n* often close to 0 which makes them very poor electrical conductors as the current will be very low.

##### Resistance
- Resistance is the opposition to current therefore, the higher the resistance, the lower the current and resistance is measured in Ohms ($\Omega$).
$$
R=\frac{V}{I}
$$
- **Ohm's law**: For a conductor at a constant temperature, the current through it is directly proportional to the potential difference across it.
- A resistor is an ohmic conductor so the current flowing through a resistor is directly proportional to the potential difference across it as long as temperature remains constant.
- A filament lamp is a non-ohmic component, as the resistance of the filament increases as the potential difference across it increases which increases the temperature of the filament.
- A diode is a non-ohmic component as a diode only conducts current in one direction, and the resistance decreases quickly as potential difference increases after the threshold potential difference.
- A light-dependant resistor (LDR) is a non-ohmic conductor and as light intensity increases, the resistance of an LDR decreases, therefore LDRs can be used as light sensors in automatic lights.
	- In LDR's when light intensity increases, the number density of charge carriers increases leading to a lower resistance.
- Resistivity is a property which describes the extent to which a material opposes the flow of electric current through it and is measured in $\Omega m$ so the higher the resistivity of a material the higher its resistance.
	- Conductors such as metals have a low resistivity while insulators have a very high resistivity.
	- As the temperature of metals increases, the metal ions vibrate with a greater frequency and amplitude so electrons collide with the vibrating metal ions more frequently so the flow of charge and current will decreases and resistivity will increase.
	- For semiconductors with a negative temperature coefficient, the number of charge carriers increases with temperature so an increase in temperature causes an decreases in resistivity.
- Resistance in a wire depends on the length of wire, cross-sectional area and resistivity of the material.
$$
R=\frac{\rho L}{A}
$$
	where $\rho$ is the resistivity of the material.
- Therefore, the longer the wire the greater its resistance and the wider the wire, the smaller its resistance.
- A thermistor is a non-ohmic conductor and has a negative temperature coefficient so as temperature increases, the resistance of the thermistor decreases, therefore thermistors can be used as temperature sensors in thermometers.

##### Circuits
- **Kirchhoff's Second Law**: The sum of the e.m.fâ€™s in a closed circuit equals the sum of the potential differences because energy is conserved. 
- When two or more components are connected in series, the combined resistance of the components is equal to the sum of individuals resistances.
$$
R=\sum_{i=1}^nR_{i}
$$
- When two or more components are connected in parallel, the reciprocal of the combined resistance is the sum of the reciprocals of the individual resistances so the combined resistance decreases.
$$
\frac{1}{R}=\sum_{i=1}^n \frac{1}{R_{i}}
$$
- When cells are connected in series, the total voltage of the resulting battery is the sum of potential differences across each cell.
- When cells are connected in parallel, the voltage across the arrangement is the same as for one cell.
- The electromotive force ($\mathcal{E}$) is the amount of chemical energy transferred to electrical energy per coulomb of charge when charge passes through a power supply.
$$
\mathcal{E}=\frac{W}{Q}
$$
- In a circuit, the e.m.f. source is from a battery or a power supply and it is equal to the potential difference across the source when no current is flowing and it is the maximum voltage available to the circuit.
	- The potential difference between two points is the electrical potential energy transferred away per unit of charge and the e.m.f. of a source is the electrical potential energy transferred into the circuit per unit of charge.
- All power supplies have some resistance called internal resistance (*r*) which causes the charge circulating to dissipate some electrical energy from the power supply itself and some voltage will be lost.
- The terminal voltage is the potential difference across terminals of a cell.
- In a closed circuit, current flows through a cell and a potential difference develops across the internal resistance which reduces the voltage available for the rest of the circuit and the difference is called 'lost volts'.
$$
\mathcal{E} = I(R+r) = V+Ir 
$$
	where *r* is the internal resistance and *V* is the terminal voltage.
 - Therefore the 'lost volts' are equal to the product of the current of the circuit with the internal resistance of the power supply.
 - Potential difference across two points in a circuit is the energy transferred per unit of charge flowing from one point to another therefore $1\,V=1\,JC^{-1}$.
 $$
 V=\frac{W}{Q}
 $$
 - Potential difference is measured using a voltmeter which is connected in parallel to the circuit and it should have a very large resistance so very little current passes through it to change the potential difference.
 - A battery transfers energy to each charge carrier which in metals are electrons and the work done by an electron accelerated through a potential difference of 1 V is equal to an electronvolt.
 $$
 W=eV=\frac{1}{2}mv^2
 $$
 - When a potential difference is applied across a conductor, the electrons are accelerated and gain kinetic energy which is equal to an electronvolt.
 - Power is the rate of energy transferred of work done in an electrical circuit.
 $$
\begin{aligned}
W =VIt \\
\implies P=IV=I^2R=\frac{V^2}{R} 
\end{aligned}
 $$
 - Energy is commonly measure in kilowatt-hours (kWh) which is the unit of energy equal to 1000 W of power sustained for 1 hour.
 - Potential dividers are circuits that produce an output voltage as a fraction of the input voltage to provide a variable potential difference.

$$
V_{out}=\frac{R_{2}}{R_{1}+R_{2}}V_{in}
$$
- A potentiometer is a potential divider to give a continuously variable output voltage with 3 terminals and a sliding contact to vary the potential difference between the two terminals
