##### Wave motion
- A progressive wave is an oscillation that transfers energy through matter or a vacuum which can be in the form of a transverse wave or longitudinal wave.
- A transverse wave is a wave in which particles oscillate perpendicular to the direction of energy transfer.
- A longitudinal wave is a wave in which the particles oscillate parallel to the direction of energy transfer creating compressions and rarefactions.
- The equilibrium position of a wave is the resting position of the particles and the midpoint in the oscillation.
- The displacement of a wave is the distance of a point on the wave from its equilibrium point.
- Amplitude is the maximum displacement of a particle in the wave from its equilibrium position.
- Wavelength is the distance between points on successive oscillations of a wave that are in phase.
- The period is the time taken for one complete oscillation or cycle of the wave.
- Frequency is the number of complete oscillations or wavelengths passing a point per unit of time.
$$
f=\frac{1}{T}
$$
- The phase difference of two waves is the difference in the stage each waves oscillation which can be found through relative position of crests or troughs which can be measured as an angle in degrees or radians.
	- If waves are in phase they have a wave difference of 0 and if they are in antiphase they have a wave difference of $\pi$ radians.
- Wave speed is the distance travelled by the wave per unit of time.
$$
v=f\lambda 
$$
- The intensity of a wave at a surface is the amount of radiant energy passing through a unit of area per unit of time.
$$
I=\frac{P}{A}
$$
- The intensity of a progressive wave is also proportional to its amplitude squared.
$$
I \propto A ^{2}
$$
- **Law of Reflection**: When a wave reflects from a surface, the angle of incidence is equal to the angle of refraction.
- Refraction occurs when waves pass a boundary between two media and change direction:
	- When waves pass from a less dense medium to a more dense medium, waves slow down bend towards the normal.
	- When waves pass from a more dense medium to a less dense medium, waves speed up bend away from the normal.
	- When waves pass along the normal, the waves do not bend.
	- If the speed of waves increases, the wavelength increases and if the speed of waves decrease, the wavelength decreases.
- When waves reflect, their wavelength and frequency remains constant where as in refraction, the wavelength of waves change due to a change in speed.
- Polarisation only occurs for transverse waves and occurs when the oscillation of transverse waves are restricted in one direction so only the planar component of the wave passes through and the waves become plane polarised from a unpolarised source.
	- Longitudinal waves cannot be polarised became their oscillations are already limited to one plane which is the direction of energy transfer.
	- When transverse waves reflect off a surface they become partially polarised.
- Diffraction is the spreading out of waves when they pass an obstruction for example a slit:
	- When the gap size is around the same size as the wavelength of the wave, the effects of diffraction are more prominent.
	- When the gap size is much larger than the wavelength, the waves are no longer spread out.

##### Electromagnetic waves
- Electromagnetic waves are transverse waves and travel at the speed of light in a vacuum where $c \approx 3.0 \times 10^8$.
- The electromagnetic spectrum from longest wavelength and lowest frequency to shortest wavelength and highest frequency is: radio waves, microwaves, infrared, visible light, ultraviolet, x-rays and gamma rays.
	- As the frequency of electromagnetic waves increases, the waves have more energy and become more ionising.
	- The order of magnitudes of wavelengths (m): radio waves ($10^6$), microwaves ($10^{-1}$), infrared ($10^{-3}$), visible ($7\times 10^{-7}-4\times 10^{-7}$), UV ($4\times 10^{-7}$), X-rays ($10^{-8}$), gamma rays ($10^{-13}$).
- Electromagnetic waves have a large number of uses:
	- Radio waves: radio communication.
	- Microwaves: heating food, communications.
	- Infrared: remote controls, fibre optic communication, thermal imaging, heating.
	- Visible light: photography.
	- Ultraviolet: security marking, sunbeds.
	- X-rays: x-ray imaging, airport security.
	- Gamma rays: sterilising food and medical instruments, treating cancer.
- Polarisation is when particle oscillations occur in only one direction perpendicular to the direction of wave propagation and waves are polarised through a polariser.
	- A plane-polarised wave only oscillates in a certain direction, perpendicular to wave propagation.
	- Polarising filters are polarisers for light which work on unpolarised light and polarised light if the transmission axis of the filter is parallel to the wave or at an angle.
	- Metal grilles are polarisers commonly used for microwaves, and can be seen in microwave ovens as light can pass through but microwaves cant for safety.
- In specular reflection, light rays reflect at the same angle where as in diffuse reflection, light is scattered, as the light reflects off the different edges of a rough surface.
- Refraction in light occurs when light waves pass a boundary between two media and undergo a change in direction.
- The refractive index, *n*, measure how much lights slows down when passing through it a particular material.
$$
n=\frac{c}{v}
$$
	where *c* is the speed of light in a vacuum and *v* is the speed of light in the material.
- The greater the refractive index, the slower light travels in the material and bends towards the normal further.
- **Snell's Law**: When light passes between media, the product of the refractive index of the medium and the sine of the angle to the normal is a constant.
$$
n_{1}\sin \theta_{1}=n_{2}\sin\theta_{2}
$$
- Total internal reflection occurs when the angle of incidence is greater than the critical angle at an internal boundary and the incident refractive index is greater that the refractive index of the material at the boundary.
- The critical angle, *C*, is the angle of incidence for which the angle of refraction is 90° and the light is refracted along the boundary between the medium and the air.
$$
\sin C=\frac{1}{n}
$$
	where *n* is the incident refractive index, so the greater the incident refractive index, the smaller the critical angle.

##### Superposition
- **Principle of Superposition**: When two or more waves with the same frequency meet at a point, the resultant displacement is the sum of the displacements of each wave.
- If two waves with the same frequency and amplitude meet at a point they superpose:
	- If they are in phase, constructive interference is caused and the amplitude doubles.
	- If they are in anti-phase, destructive interference is caused and the resultant wave has no amplitude as the peaks and troughs are lined up.
- Waves or sources of waves are coherent if they have the same frequency and a constant phase difference.
	- Interference is the superposition of coherent waves to create a resultant wave.
- Path difference is the difference in the distance travelled by two waves from their sources to the point where they meet.
	- Path difference is determined in multiples of a wavelength and constructive interference occurs when there is a path difference of $n\lambda$ and $\left( n+\frac{1}{2} \right)\lambda , \, n∈\mathbb{N_{0}}$ for destructive interference.
- Phase difference is the difference in phase between two waves that meet at the same point.
	- Phase difference is determined by an angle, and constructive interference occurs if there is a phase difference of $n\pi, \,n∈ \{\ 2k : k∈\mathbb{N_{0}} \ \}$ and $n\pi, \,n∈ \{\ 2k + 1 : k∈\mathbb{N_{0}} \ \}$ for destructive interference.
- When constructive interference occurs between two sound waves, the sound appears louder and when destructive interference occurs the sound is quieter.
- Young's double-slit experiment demonstrates how light waves can produce an interference pattern of bright and dark fringes when light from a monochromatic source is passed through a double slit.
	- This confirms the wave-nature of light which was proposed in Huygens Wave Theory of Light which describes light as a series of wavefronts.
- The double-slit equation can be used to calculate the wavelength of light but is only true when the distance between the double slit to the screen is much greater than the distance between the centres of the slits.
$$
\lambda=\frac{ax}{D}, \ \ for \ \ D\gg a
$$
	where *a* is the distance between the centres of the slit, *x* is the distance between successive bright fringes and *D* is the distance from the double slit to the screen.
- If the distance between slits and distance from the double slit to the screen remain constant, the wavelength of light is proportional to the distance between successive bright fringes.

##### Stationary waves
- Stationary waves are produced by the superposition of two waves with the same frequency and ideally same amplitude travelling in opposite direction.
- Stationary waves store energy unlike progressive waves which transfer energy as the progressive waves are travelling in opposite directions so there is no net energy transfer.
- Stationary waves are made up of nodes and antinodes, and nodes are fixed in position:
	- At nodes, the waves are in anti-phase so destructive interference occurs so there is no vibration.
	- At the antinodes, the waves are in phase meaning constructive interference occurs and the vibration is at maximum amplitude.
- The wavelength of a stationary wave is equal to twice the separation between adjacent nodes or antinodes whereas in progressive waves is the separation between adjacent peaks.
- The amplitude of a stationary wave is equal to the amplitude at the antinode, however only particles at the node will vibrate with this amplitude whereas on progressive waves all waves vibrate with the same amplitude.
- The phase difference between points in-between adjacent nodes is 0 whereas the points either side of a node are in antiphase. 
- When a stationary wave is fixed at both ends, the simplest wave pattern is a single loop made up of two nodes at either end and an antinode which is called the fundamental mode of vibration or first harmonic.
	- As the frequency is increased, the higher harmonics appear and the wave will have more antinodes.
	- The frequency of the first harmonic is the fundamental frequency, $f_{0}$, the minimum frequency for a stationary wave and for the nth harmonic, the frequency will be $nf_{0}$.
- Stationary waves on strings occur when a string is stretched between two points which act as nodes, and when the string is plucked a progressive wave travels along the string and reflects leading to a stationary wave with its fundamental frequency over higher order harmonics.
- Stationary sound waves can occur in tubes open at one end, which have a node at the closed end and antinode at the open end, meaning the wavelength is 4 times the length of the tube, and the air will vibrate in the tube at the fundamental frequency and reflect of the open end due to a difference in pressure.
	- Unlike stationary waves on strings it is not possible to form harmonics of even multiple of the fundamental frequency, only odd multiples.
- Stationary sound waves can occur in tubes open at each end, which have an antinode on each end an a node in-between them and the air will vibrate in the tube at the fundamental frequency, meaning the wavelength is 2 times the length of the tube.
	- Unlike a tube closed at one end it is possible to form harmonics all all integer multiples of the fundamental frequency.
