##### Work
- Energy is the capacity to do work.
- Work is the amount of energy transferred when a force causes an object to move a certain distance and 1 J is the work done when a 1 N force is used over a distance of 1 m.
$$
W = Fx = Fx\ cos\theta
$$
- **Principle of Conservation of Energy**: In a closed system, energy cannot be created or destroyed and can only be transferred from one form to another.
- When energy is transferred from one store to another not all the energy will end up in the desired form as some energy is dissipated and transferred to the surroundings as thermal, light and sound energy.
- Forms of energy:
	- **Kinetic energy**: energy due to motion of an object with mass or the work done by an object in motion.
	- **Gravitational potential energy**: energy of an object due to its position in a gravitational field or the work done against gravity when an object is lifted.
	- **Chemical energy**: energy contained within chemical bonds between atoms.
	- **Elastic potential energy**: energy stored in an object as a result of reversible change in its shape or the work done by stretching or compressing and object.
	- **Electrical potential energy**: energy of electrical charges due to their position in an electric field.
	- **Nuclear energy**: energy within the nuclei of atoms.
	- **Radiant energy**: energy of electromagnetic waves stored within oscillating electric and magnetic fields.
	- **Sound energy**: energy of mechanical waves due to movement of atoms.
	- **Internal energy**: the sum of kinetic and potential energies of atoms in a system.
- Kinetic energy is directly proportional to an object's mass and directly proportional to the square of its speed.
$$
\begin{aligned}
E_k = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 \\
v^2 = u^2 + 2as,\ \ a = \frac{v^2}{2d} \ \ when\ \ u=0\ \ and\ \ s=d \\
F = ma = \frac{mv^2}{2d} \\
W = Fd = \frac{mv^2}{2d} d = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 \\
\end{aligned}
$$
- The gravitational potential energy gained when an object is lifted is proportional to its change in height.
$$
\begin{aligned}
E_p = mgh \\
F = ma = mg \\
W = Fh = mgh \\ 
\end{aligned}
$$
- When an object is falling without resistive forces, its loss in potential energy is equal to its gain in kinetic energy.

##### Power
- Power is the **rate of energy transfer** and measured in watts and 1 W is the transfer of 1 J in 1 s.
$$
P = \frac{E}{t} = \frac{W}{t}
$$
- When a **constant force** causes an object to move at a **constant velocity** the power developed by the force can be calculated.
$$
\begin{aligned}
P = Fv \\
W = Fd = Fvt \\
P = \frac{W}{t} = \frac{Fvt}{t} = Fv \\ 
\end{aligned}
$$
- **Efficiency** is the ratio of the useful power output from a system to its total power input and measures how much energy is dissipated.
- Machines can be made more efficient by reducing friction, air resistance, electrical resistance and vibrations.
