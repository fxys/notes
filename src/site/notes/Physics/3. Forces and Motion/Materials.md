##### Springs
- A pair of opposite **tensile forces** stretch a body causing tensile deformation whereas a pair of **opposite compressive** forces compress a body causing compressive deformation.
- When a load is applied to a spring, it produces a tensile force that caused the spring to extend.
- **Hooke's Law**: The extension of the material is directly proportional to the applied force up to the limit of proportionality.
$$
\begin{aligned}
F \propto x \\
F = kx
\end{aligned}
$$
- The **force constant**, *k*, is measured in N/m and measures the stiffness of a spring.
- In elastic deformation the spring returns to its original length where as in plastic deformation, the spring remains permanently extended.

- **Force-extension graphs** show how a material responds to a force:
	- The **gradient** of the Hooke's law region represents the force constant.
	- The **limit of proportionality** is the point beyond which Hooke's law is no longer true.
	- The **elastic limit** is the maximum amount a spring can be stretched and return to its original length.
	- The **area** underneath the graph is equal to the work done by the material: for Hooke's law region, the area is easily calculated:
$$
E_e = \frac{1}{2}Fx = \frac{1}{2}(kx)x = \frac{1}{2}kx^2$$



- **Elastic potential energy** measures how much energy is stored within a material after forces are exerted.
- Examples:

 - **Metal Wire**:

	- The wire obeys Hooke's law and is elastically deformed until its elastic limit.
	- After the elastic limit the wire experiences plastic deformation causing a permanent extension of the wire.

- **Rubber**:
	- Rubber does not obey Hooke's law but does not experience plastic deformation.
	- The area between the loading and unloading curves is known as a hysteresis loop and represents the thermal energy dissipated by rubber.
	- More work is done when stretching rubber than is done when the extension decreases.

- **Polyethene**:
	- Polyethene does not obey Hooke's law and easily experiences plastic deformation when a force is applied.

##### Properties
- **Tensile stress** is the force exerted per unit of cross-sectional area of a material and is measured in pascals.
$$
\sigma = \frac{F}{A}
$$
- **Strain** is the extension per unit of length or the ratio between extension and length.
$$
\epsilon = \frac{x}{L}
$$
- The **ultimate tensile strength** of a material is the maximum amount of load or stress a material can handle before it fractures.
- The **Young modulus** is the measure of the ability of a material to withstand changes in length with added load.
$$
E = \frac{\sigma}{\epsilon}
$$

- **Stress-strain graphs** show whether materials show the properties of materials:
	- The **gradient** of the Hooke's law region is equal to the Young modulus of the material.
	- The **area** under the graph is equal to the energy stored per unit of volume of the material.
	- The **elastic region** is where the material will return to its original shape when the applied force is removed.
	- The **plastic region** is where the material will not return to its original shape.
	- The **yield stress** is the point at which the material extends plastically for a small increase in stress.
	- The **breaking point** is the point where the material breaks and the stress at this point is the breaking strength of a material.
- **Brittle** materials fracture before plastic deformation and show elastic behaviour up to their breaking point.

- **Ductile** materials can withstand large plastic deformation without breaking.
![Pasted image 20230706141051.png](/img/user/Attachments/Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020230706141051.png)
- **Polymeric** materials are made up repeating chains of molecules and endure high amounts of stress before breaking and don't plastically deform.
