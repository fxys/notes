##### Dynamics
- The resultant force of an object is the sum of all the forces acting on it.
- The **resultant force** acting on an object is equal to the product of its mass and acceleration therefore a resultant force will accelerate an object.
$$
F = ma
$$
- Force is measured in **newtons** (N) orÂ kg ms<sup>-2</sup>, therefore 1 N of force will accelerate an object of 1 kg at 1 ms<sup>-2</sup>.
- **Weight** is the effect of a gravitational field on a mass.
$$
W = mg
$$
- Weight may be considered to act at the **centre of mass** of an object:
	- The centre of mass of a uniform solid is its centre where the objects entire mass is concentrated.
	- An object is stable when its centre of mass lies above its base: the wider base an object has, the lower its centre of mass is making it more stable.
	- When an irregular object is suspended from a point, its centre of mass comes to rest below the pivoting point.
	- To determine the centre of mass of an irregular object, hang the object from one corner with a plump line using a clamp stand and draw a line where the plump line falls and repeat with another corner to find the intersection of the lines.
	- **Centre of gravity** is only identical to the centre of mass in a uniform magnetic field and it is the point where weight acts on an object.
- **Tension** is the force experienced by a cable or rope when stretched.
- The **normal contact force** is the force experienced by an object resting against another object that acts at right angles to the plane of contact.
- **Drag** forces oppose the motion of a moving object and include:
	- **Friction** is the force that arises when two surfaces are in contact with each other
	- **Air resistance** is the friction of air acting on an object moving in air and it is affected by the speed of the object (drag is proportional to the square of speed), cross-sectional area, shape, altitude, temperature and humidity.
- An object falling in a uniform gravitational field in the presence of drag:
	- The moment the object is released, the acceleration of the object will be *g* due to a resultant force due to its weight and it's velocity will increase from 0.
	- As the velocity of the object increases the drag force acting on the object will increase opposing the downwards motion causing a lower resultant force and an acceleration less than *g*.
	- Eventually the object will reach **terminal velocity** when the drag force is equal to its weight and the acceleration will be 0.
- **Terminal velocity** is the constant speed that a freely falling object reaches when the resistance of the medium through which the object is falling through prevents further acceleration. 

##### Equilibrium
- A **moment** is the turning effect of a force which occur when forces cause objects to rotate about a pivot.
$$
M = Fd = Fd\ cos\theta
$$
	where *d* is the distance to the pivot.
- **Principle of moments**: For a system to be in rotational equilibrium, the sum of clockwise moments about a pivot must be equal to the sum of the anticlockwise moments about the same pivot.
- A **couple** is a pair of equal and opposite forces acting on the same plane but not on the same line which produces a rotation and a resultant force of 0.
- The moment of a couple is known as **torque**.
$$
\tau = Fd
$$
	where *d* is the perpendicular distance between the forces.
- A system is in **equilibrium** when all the forces are balanced which means there is no resultant force or resultant torque meaning the object will remain at rest or maintain motion at a constant velocity and will not rotate.
- An object is in equilibrium if the forces acting on it can be represented by a closed vector triangle of forces because the net force is equal to 0.

##### Pressure
- **Density** is the mass per unit of volume of an object.
- **Pressure** is the concentration of the force and is the force per unit of area.
$$
p = \frac{F}{A}
$$
- Pressure in a vertical column of a liquid is proportional to the height of the column.
$$
p = h\rho g
$$
- **Archimedes' principle**: An object submerged in a fluid at rest has an upthrust equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the object.
$$
upthrust = \rho gV
$$
- An object will sink until the weight of the fluid displaced is equal to its own weight, therefore, the mass of a floating object on water is equal to the mass of the water it displaced.
- As altitude increases, the boiling point of water decreases because the molecules require less energy to overcome a lower air pressure.
