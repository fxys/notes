##### Kinematics
- **Displacement** is the distance of an object from a fixed point in a specific direction whereas **distance** is the total length between two points.
- **Velocity** is the rate of change of displacement of an object and is a vector quantity whereas **average speed** is the total distance travelled per unit of time and is a scalar quantity.
$$
v = \frac{\Delta s}{\Delta t}
$$
- **Acceleration** is the rate of change of velocity of an object.
$$
a = \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t}
$$
##### Motion Graphs
- Time is always on the x-axis.
- **Distance-time graphs:**
	- The **gradient** represents the speed and the instantaneous speed (speed at a specific moment in time) of a curved graph is found by drawing a tangent.	
	- Distance-time graphs can't have a negative gradient and distance travelled can only increase.
- **Displacement-time graphs:**
	 - The **gradient** represents the velocity of the object. 
	 - The **y-intercept** represents the initial displacement of an object.
- **Velocity-time graphs:**
	- The **gradient** represents the acceleration of the object and a straight line means uniform acceleration.
	- An object with a velocity of 0 is at rest.
	- The **area** underneath the graph represents the displacement or distance travelled.
- Example: bouncing ball:
	![Pasted image 20230705145805.png](/img/user/Attachments/Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020230705145805.png)
	- The ball constantly decelerates at -9.81 ms<sup>-2</sup> (*-g*).
	- At point A in time, the ball reaches maximum displacement and has a velocity of 0 as its velocity becomes negative.
	- At point B in time, the ball reaches minimum displacement and the velocity changes to positive causing a momentary positive acceleration.

##### Linear Motion
- Motion with **constant acceleration** can be calculated using the following equations:
$$
v=u+at
$$
$$
s = \frac{1}{2}(u+v)t
$$
$$
s = ut+\frac{1}{2}at^2
$$
$$
v^2 = u^2+2as
$$
- The acceleration of **free fall** due to gravity is *g* which is taken to be equal to 9.81 ms<sup>-2</sup> as it varies with altitude and latitude.
- An object is in free fall when there are no forces acting on it other then the force of gravity which means the object will accelerate vertically downwards towards the centre of the earth.
- The acceleration of free fall can be determined by measuring the time an object takes to fall a known distance if air resistance is ignored.
$$
g=\frac{2s}{t^2}
$$
- The **stopping distance** of a vehicle is the distance travelled in the time taken to stop in response to an hazard.
$$
stopping\ \ distance\ =\ thinking\ \ distance\ +\ braking\ \ distance
$$
- The thinking distance is the distance travelled in the time taken for the driver to react to the hazard and is directly proportional to the initial speed of the vehicle.
$$
thinking\ \ distance\ =\ u\ Ã—\ reaction\ \ time
$$
- Thinking distance is increased by intoxication, distractions or tiredness which all increase the reaction time of the driver.
- The braking distance is the distance travelled from the points the brakes are applied until the vehicle comes to a stop and is directly proportional to the square of the initial speed of the vehicle.
$$
braking\ \ distance\ \propto\ u^2
$$
- This is because the work done by the brakes is equal to the initial kinetic energy of the vehicle which has to be dissipated to the surroundings as thermal energy by the brakes.
$$
work\ \ done\ \ by\ \ brakes \approx E_k \ \ \therefore \ \ Fd \approx \frac{1}{2}mv^2\ \ (where\ \ F = braking\ \ force)
$$
- Braking distance is increased by the initial speed of the vehicle, the mass of the vehicle, poor road conditions, weather (e.g. ice or rain which decreases friction with the road) or poor vehicle conditions (e.g. worm brakes or tires).

##### Projectile Motion
- The vertical and horizontal components of motion of an object are independent.
- The horizontal acceleration of an projectile is 0 however the vertical velocity changes due to the acceleration of free fall.
- The initial vertical velocity is: $$u\sin\theta$$and the horizontal vertical velocity is:$$u\cos\theta$$
- **Time of flight** of a projectile can be calculated with the equation:
$$
t = \frac{2u\ sin\theta}{g}
$$
- The **maximum height** reached by a projectile can be calculated with the equation:
$$
H = \frac{(u\ sin\theta)^2}{2g}
$$
- The **range** of the projectile can be calculated with the equation:
$$
R = \frac{u^2\ sin2\theta}{g}
$$
