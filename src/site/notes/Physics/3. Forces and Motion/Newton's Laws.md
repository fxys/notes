##### Motion
- **Newton's First Law**: An object will remain at rest or move with constant velocity unless acted on by a resultant force.
- **Newton's Second Law**: The resultant force is directly proportional to the rate of change of momentum and the change in momentum is in the same direction as the resultant force.
- **Newton's Third Law**: When two objects interact, they exert equal and opposite forces on each other.
- **Linear momentum** is the product of mass and velocity meaning momentum is a vector quantity.
$$
p = mv
$$
$$
\begin{aligned}
F \propto \frac{\Delta p}{\Delta t} \\
F = \frac{\Delta p}{\Delta t} = \frac{mv - mu}{t} = m(\frac{v - u}{t}) = ma
\end{aligned}
$$
- $F=ma$ is therefore a special case of Newton's second law where the mass of the object remains constant during the period of acceleration.
- **Impulse** of a force is equal to the change in momentum when the force applied is constant.
$$
J = F\Delta t = \Delta p = mv - mu
$$
- **Force-time graphs** show how the force exerted varies over time.
	- The **area** under the graph is equal to the impulse of a force.

##### Collisions
- **Principle of Conservation of Momentum**: The total momentum before a collision is equal to the total momentum after a collision, as long as no external forces act on the system.
- In an **perfectly elastic collision**, kinetic energy is conserved whereas in an **inelastic collision**, kinetic energy is not conserved.
- Example: resolving momentum for oblique collisions:

	- The figure shows a general collision when two objects, one moving and one stationary, collide and travel in different directions however the momentum in any direction must be conserved.
	- Momentum in *x* direction:
		$total\ initial\ momentum = total\ final\ momentum$ 
		$m_1v_0 = m_1v_1cos\theta _1 + m_2v_2cos\theta _2$ 
	- Momentum in *y* direction:
		$total\ initial\ momentum = total\ final\ momentum$ 
		$0 = m_1v_1sin\theta _1 + m_2v_2sin\theta _2$
