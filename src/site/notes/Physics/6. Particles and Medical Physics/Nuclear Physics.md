##### Nuclear Atom
- The alpha particle scattering experiment consisted of alpha particles fired at thing gold foil and a detector to detect how many particles were deflected at different angles.
	- The experiment showed that the atoms is mainly empty space as the majority of alpha particles went straight through the gold foil. 
	- The experiment showed that there is a positive nucleus at the centre as some alpha particles were deflected by small angles.
	- The experiment showed the nucleus is very small and is the point at which the mass and charge is concentrated as only very few alpha particles deflected straight back at large angles.
- As atoms as mostly empty space the diameter if atoms is around $10^{-10}m$ and the diameter of the nucleus is around $10^{-15}m$.
- The proton number of atoms represents the number of protons in the nucleus and the nucleon number, *A*, is the number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus.
- An isotope is an atom that of the same element with the same number of protons but a different number of neutrons.
- The force that holds a nucleus together is the strong nuclear force which holds quarks together to ensure the nucleus holds together due to the electrostatic repulsion between protons.
	- The strong nuclear force is repulsive before a separation of 0.5 fm and attractive to around 3.0 fm when it become 0 so the strong force has a small range compared to other fundamental forces.
- The nuclear radius varies with the nucleon number, however, it is not directly proportional.
$$
R=r_{0}A^{\frac{1}{3}}
$$
	where $r_{0}$ is the constant of proportionality, the radius of a proton.
- The density of the nucleus is constant and independent of the nucleon number showing that nucleons are evenly separated throughout the nucleus.

##### Fundamental Particles
- All matter particles have **antimatter** counterparts of the same mass but with the opposite charge: positrons have a charge of +e, anti-protons have a charge of -e, and anti-neutrons and anti-neutrinos are neutral.
- **Hadrons** are particles made up of quarks, so they are subjected to the strong and weak nuclear force, and they are classed as **baryons**, made up of 3 quarks and have a baryon number of 1, and **mesons**, made up of a quark and anti-quark pair.
	- **Anti-hadrons** are classified as anti-baryons, made up of 3 anti-quarks and have a baryon number of -1, and anti-mesons, made up of a anti-quark and quark pair.
	- Protons are hadrons made up of two up quarks and a down quark and neutrons are made up of two down quarks and an up quark.
- **Leptons** are fundamental particles and include the electron and neutrino and they are subject to the weak nuclear force.
- Quarks are fundamental particles and include the flavours up, down and strange and they make up other subatomic particles.
	- An up quark ($u$) has a charge of $+\frac{2}{3}e$ and baryon number of $\frac{1}{3}$ and an anti-up quark ($\bar{u}$) has a charge of $-\frac{2}{3}e$ and a baryon number of $-\frac{1}{3}$.
	- A down quark ($d$) has a charge of $-\frac{1}{3}e$ and baryon number of $\frac{1}{3}$ and an anti-down quark ($\bar{d}$) has a charge of $+\frac{1}{3}e$ and a baryon number of $-\frac{1}{3}$.
	- A strange quark ($s$) has a charge of $-\frac{1}{3}e$ and baryon number of $\frac{1}{3}$ and an anti-strange quark ($\bar{s}$) has a charge of $+\frac{1}{3}e$ and a baryon number of $-\frac{1}{3}$.
- In beta-minus decay, a neutron decays into a proton emitting an electron, a beta-minus particle ($\beta^-$) , and anti-electron neutrino so in the daughter nucleus the proton number increases by 1 and nucleon number remains the same.
	- In beta-minus decay a neutron turns into a proton because a down quark becomes an up quark via the weak nuclear force.
$$
\begin{align}
n \to p + e^- + \bar{\nu_{e}} \\
d \to u+e^- + \bar{\nu_{e}}
\end{align}
$$
- In beta-plus decay, a proton decays into a neutron emitting a positron, a beta-plus particle ($\beta^+$), and electron neutrino so in the daughter nucleus the proton number decreases by 1 and nucleon number remains the same.
	- In beta-plus decay a proton turns into a neutron because an up quark becomes a down quark via the weak nuclear force.
$$
\begin{align}
p \to n + e^+ + \nu_{e} \\
u \to d + e^+ + \nu_{e}
\end{align}
$$
- Quark transformation equations must be balanced in terms of charge and baryon number.

##### Radioactive Decay
- Atomic nuclei are unstable when there is an imbalance in the forces within the nucleus and can emit radiation to become more stable.
- Radioactive decay is random so it can't be known which nucleus will decay next or at what time as each nucleus has an equal probability of decaying and decay is spontaneous so the decay of nuclei is not affected by the presence of other nuclei or external factors such as pressure.
- Alpha particles are helium nuclei that have low penetrating power and a range of a few cm in air and beta particles have a moderate penetrating power and a range of a few m in air and gamma rays are high energy electromagnetic waves so have a high range.
	- Alpha particles and beta particles are affected by electric and magnetic fields where as gamma radiation is not and all radiation from the nucleus is ionising and can cause cellular mutations.
- Activity is the number of decays per unit time and the decay constant, $\lambda$, is the probability, per unit time, that a given nucleus will decay and activity is proportional to the number of undecayed nuclei and is measured in Becquerels.
$$
A=\lambda N
$$
	where *N* is the number of undecayed nuclei.
- Half life is the average time taken for the initial number of nuclei or the activity of a source to reduce by half and it is inversely proportional to the decay constant.
$$
\lambda t_{\frac{1}{2}}=\ln(2)
$$
	where $t_{\frac{1}{2}}$ is the half life.
- The number of undecayed nuclei and the activity can be modelled by exponential decay equations.
$$
\begin{align}
N=N_{0}e^{-\lambda t} \\
A=A_{0}e^{-\lambda t}
\end{align}
$$
-  Radioactive decay can be modelled by dice, which represent undecayed nuclei. by rolling the dice and removing ones that land with a 6, to represent decayed nuclei, and the number of dice will fall exponentially each iteration.
- Carbon-dating works by analysing carbon-14, which the proportion of is constant in living organism as carbon is being replaced constantly but the activity of carbon-14 decreases when they die as carbon is no longer replaced.
	- Sample can be dated by comparing the ratio of carbon-14 to carbon-12 in them with living material.
	- Carbon-dating is less reliable for samples less than 1000 years old as the activity of the sample will be too high and less reliable for samples more than 50000 years old as the half life or carbon-14 is around 5700 years so the activity will be too small compared to the background.
- Dating rocks requires isotopes with a long half-life such as rubidium-87 which is commonly used as it has a half life of 49 billion years.

##### Nuclear Power
- The mass-energy equivalence proposes that mass can be converted into energy and energy can be converted into mass.
$$
E=mc^2
$$
- Annihilation of matter is when a particle meets its equivalent anti-particle and they are destroyed and their mass is converted to energy in the form of two gamma ray photons.
- Pair production is when a photon interacts with a nucleus and the energy of the photon is used to create a particle anti-particle pair and this is the process of creation.
- The binding energy is the energy required to split a nucleus apart and can be found by substituting the mass defect, difference in mass between an atom's mass and sum of the masses of its constituent parts, into the mass-energy equivalence formula.
- Binding energy per nucleon is the binding energy of a nucleus divided by the number of nucleons and is more useful to compare nuclear stability.
	- Nuclei with lower nucleon number compared to iron-56 have a lower binding energy per nucleon and are generally less stable.
	- As nucleon number increases beyond iron-56 to binding energy per nucleon remains high but gradually decreases.

- Nuclear fission is the splitting of large, unstable nuclei into two smaller daughter nuclei and energy is transferred away from nuclear potential energy.
	- Induced fission is when an unstable nucleus absorbs a neutron to make it more unstable to it splits into daughter nuclei by nuclear fission releasing more neutrons in the process.
	- As new neutrons are produced in fission reactions, these neutrons can start another fission reaction which creates further excess neutrons and this process is a chain reaction.
- **Nuclear fission reactor**:
	![Pasted image 20250227194740.png](/img/user/Attachments/Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250227194740.png)
	- The moderator surrounds the fuel rods and control rods which slows down the fast-moving neutrons so they can react efficiently with the uranium fuel.
	- The control rods absorb neutrons so they can be used to increase or decrease the rate of fission
	- The coolant transfers energy away from the reactor to a separate boiler to produce steam.
	- Nuclear fission reactors produced nuclear waste which is radioactive and must be contained.
- Nuclear fusion is the combination of smaller nuclei to make a larger nuclei and energy is released and the nuclei must have high kinetic energy to overcome the repulsive force.
