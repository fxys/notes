##### Point Charges
- An electric field is a region where an electric charge experiences a force and if other charges enter the field they will experience a force which is either attractive or repulsive.
- The charge of a sphere may be considered to be a point charge at its centre and a uniform spherical conductor is one where its charge is distributed evenly.
- If the object is positively charged, the field lines are radially directed away from the centre and if the object is negatively charged, the field lines are radially directed towards the centre.
- A uniform electric field has the same electric field strength throughout the field which is represented by equally space field lines between objects and in non-uniform electric fields the closer the field lines are the stronger the electric field strength.
- The electric field strength is the electric force per unit positive charge acting on the charge at that point.
$$
E=\frac{F}{Q}
$$
- The magnitude of the electric field strength in a uniform field between two charged parallel plates depends on the potential difference and the separation of the plates.
$$
E=\frac{V}{d}
$$
- **Coulomb's Law**: The electrostatic force between two point charges is proportional to the product of the charges and inversely proportional to the square of their separation.
$$
F=\frac{Qq}{4\pi \epsilon_{0} r^2}
$$
	where $Q, q$ are the magnitude of the charges, $\epsilon_{0}$ is the permittivity of free space equal to $8.85 \times 10^{-12} C^2N^{-1}m^{-2}$.
- For like charges, the electrostatic force is positive and the charges repeal and for opposite charges the electrostatic force is negative and the charges attract.
- The electric field strength of a point charge proves electric field strength in a radial field is not constant and obeys the inverse square law.
$$
E=\frac{Q}{4\pi \epsilon_{0} r^2}
$$
- A dielectric is a poor conductor of electricity but a good supporter of electric fields.
- When polar molecules align with electric fields, they produce their own electric field which opposes the electric field from the plates and the larger the opposing electric field, the larger the permittivity.
- Relative permittivity is the ratio of the permittivity of a material to the permittivity of free space.
$$
\epsilon_{r}=\frac{\epsilon}{\epsilon_{0}}
$$
- The capacitance of a capacitor can be written in terms of the relative permittivity.
$$
C=\frac{A\epsilon_{0}\epsilon_{r}}{d}
$$
	where A is the cross-sectional area of the plates, d is the separation of the plates, $\epsilon_r$ is the relative permittivity of the dielectric between the plates.
- If a charged particles remains at rest in a uniform electric field it will move parallel to the electric field lines and if the charged particles is in motion it will travel in a parabolic trajectory as it experiences an electrostatic force.

##### Electric Potential
- The potential energy of a positive charge increases if it is moved closer to another positive charge or moved away from a negative charge.
- Electrical potential at a point is the work down per unit positive charge in bringing a point charge from infinity to the defined point which is zero at infinity, positive around an isolated positive charge and negative around an isolated negative charge.
$$
V=\frac{Q}{4\pi \epsilon_{0}r}
$$
	where *Q* is the point charge producing the potential, *r* is the distance from the centre of the point charge.
- For a positive charge as the distance from the it decreases, the potential increases as work had to be done on the positive charge to overcome the repulsive force.
- For a negative charge as the distance from it decreases, the potential decreases as less work had to be done on a positive charge as the attractive force increases.
- The capacitance of a charged sphere is defined as the charge per unit potential at the surface of the sphere.
$$
C=\frac{Q}{V}=4\pi \epsilon_{0} R
$$
- The force-distance graph for two charges follows the inverse square law an the area under the graph is work done.
- The work done in moving a charge is proportional to its change in electric potential and the change in work done is the electric potential energy.
$$
\Delta W=q\Delta V=\frac{Qq}{4 \pi \epsilon_{0} \Delta r}
$$
- Work is done when a positive charge in an electric field moves against the electric field lines or when a negative charge moves with the electric field lines.
