##### Magnetic Fields
- Magnetic fields are created by permanent magnets or moving electric charges.
- A magnetic field is produced on a bar magnet by the movement of electrons within the magnet.
- The direction of a magnetic field is always from north to south and like poles repeal each other which opposite poles attract each other.
- The direction of the field lines show the direction of the force that a free magnetic north pole would experience.
- A uniform magnetic fields where the magnetic field strength is the same at all points which is represented by equally space parallel field lines.
- In a current-carrying wire, the magnetic field lines are circular rings around the wire which are further apart the further away from the wire you are and the direction of the magnetic field is determined by Maxwell's right hand screw rule.
- In a solenoid, one end becomes a north pole and the other end becomes the south pole and to determine the direction of the magnetic field you can use the right hand grip rule.
	- The strength of the magnetic field can be increased by adding a ferrous core or adding more turns in the coil.
- In a flat circular coil, the field lines will emerge through one side of the circle and leave the other. 
- Fleming's left hand rule can be used to determine the direction of the magnetic force on a moving charged particle in a magnetic field.
- The direction of the magnetic field into or out of the page is represented by crosses and dots respectively.
- The maximum magnetic force on a moving charge particle is always perpendicular to its velocity so magnetic forces cause charge particles to move in a circle.
- The magnetic flux density or magnetic field strength is the force acting per unit current per unit length on a current-carrying conductor place perpendicular to the magnetic field and its is measured in tesla.
$$
B=\frac{F}{IL}
$$
-  A current-carrying conductor produces its own magnetic field so an external magnetic field will exert a force on it and the maximum force occurs when the conductor is perpendicular to the magnetic field.
$$
F=BIL\sin \theta
$$
	where $\theta$ is the angle between the conductor and the magnetic field lines.
- The magnetic force on an isolated moving charged particle in a magnetic field is maximised when the particle is moving perpendicular to the field lines.
$$
F=BQv\sin \theta
$$
	where $\theta$ is the angle between the direction of the charged particle and the magnetic field lines.
- A charged particle in a uniform magnetic field which is perpendicular to its direction of motion travels in a circular path.
- A velocity selector is a device consisting of perpendicular electric and magnetic fields where charged particles with a specific velocity can be filtered as they are the only ones that travel through the target slit.

##### Electromagnetism
- Magnetic flux is the product of the magnetic flux density and the cross-sectional area perpendicular to the direction of the magnetic flux density and its is measured in Webers (Wb).
$$
\phi = BA = BA\cos \theta
$$
	where $\theta$ is the angles between the magnetic field lines and the normal to the plane of the area.
- Magnetic flux is a quantity which signifies how much of a magnetic field passes perpendicularly though an area.
- The magnetic flux linkage is the product of the magnetic flux and the number of turns on the coil which is measured in Weber turns (Wb turns).
$$
flux\ linkage=\phi N
$$
-  **Faraday's Law**: The magnitude of the induced electromotive force is directly proportional to the rate of change of magnetic flux linkage.
- **Lenz's Law**: The induced electromotive force is in the direction to produce effects that oppose the change causing it.
$$
\mathcal{E} = -\frac{\Delta(N\phi)}{\Delta t}
$$
- When a coil rotates in a uniform magnetic field, the flux through the coil will vary as it rotates and the electromotive force induced is an alternating voltage.
- An alternator is a type of generator that converts mechanical energy to electrical energy in the form of alternating current.
	- A metal coil in spun in a uniform magnetic field and the coil is connected by metal brushes on slip rings which provide a continuous connection.
	- The coil cuts through the magnetic field lines and a potential difference, and therefore current, is induced in the coil.
	- The current in the circuit repeatedly changed direction as the coil spins so it alternates.
- A dynamo is a direct-current generator which has a split-ring commutator which changed the connections between the coil every half turn to keep the current going in the same direction which occurs when the coil is perpendicular to the field lines.
- A transformer is a device that changes high alternating voltage at low current to low alternating voltage at high current, and vice versa.
- Transformers increase the efficiency of electrical transmissions as the power dissipated is lower as the lines run on a low current.
	- In the primary coil, an alternating current is applied which creates an alternating magnetic field inside the iron core and a changing magnetic flux linkage.
	- The changing magnetic field passes through the secondary coil which results in a changing magnetic flux linkage and by Faraday's Law an electromotive force is induced in the secondary coil which is at the same frequency as the input.
- A step-up transformer increase potential difference and a step-down transform decreases potential difference and in an ideal transformer, no energy is lost, and the power in the primary coil is the power in the secondary coil.
$$
\frac{V_{p}}{V_{s}}=\frac{N_{p}}{N_{s}}=\frac{I_{s}}{I_{p}}
$$
- Transformers can be made more efficient by using lower resistance wires to reduce power loss between input and output, as well as laminating the core with layers of iron separated by an insulator by minimising currents induced in the core.
