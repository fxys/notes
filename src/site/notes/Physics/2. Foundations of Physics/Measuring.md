##### Measuring
- **Precision**: Precise results have little spread about the mean value and the greater number of significant figures of a measurement the more precise it is.
- **Accuracy**: Accurate results are close to the true value and accuracy can be increased by repeating results to calculating a mean average and identify anomalies.
- When drawing tables, generally, the independent variable goes in the column on the left and the dependant variable goes in the column on the right.
- When labelling graphs, the independent variable should be plotted on the x-axis and the dependant variable should be plotted on the y-axis.

##### Errors
- **Random errors**: Random errors cause unpredictable fluctuations in readings due to factors such as the environment which decreases precision.
	- Random error can be reduced by repeating measurements and calculating a mean average.
- **Systematic errors**: Systematic errors affect the accuracy of all results due to faults in instruments or experimentation methods.
	- Systematic errors can be reduced by calibrating instruments correctly and using correct experimentation techniques.
- **Zero errors**: A zero error is a type of systematic error which is when an instrument gives a reading when the true value is zero.
	- A zero error can be removed by subtracting the offset from each measurement.
- The **uncertainty** of a measurement is a range of values around a measurement within which the true value is expected to lie:
	- Absolute uncertainty is where uncertainty is given as a fixed quantity (e.g. 200 ± 4m).
	- Percentage uncertainty is where uncertainty is given as a percentage (e.g. 200m ± 2%).
- In analogue apparatus, the uncertainty is equal to half the resolution of the instrument however for rulers, the uncertainty is equal to the resolution due to the uncertainty of the start and end point.
- In digital apparatus, the uncertainty is equal to the resolution of the instrument.
- Stopwatches cause an uncertainty of 0.5 seconds due to the human reaction time.
- The uncertainty in experiments is equal to half the range of of the data.
- To reduce uncertainty:
	- Use an instrument with an appropriate resolution.
	- Measure multiple instances, for example measure the time taken for 10 swings of a pendulum instead of 1.
- When the two values with uncertainty are added or subtracted, the absolute uncertainties are added.
- When two values with uncertainties are multiplies or divided, the percentage uncertainties are added.
- To calculated the percentage uncertainty of a gradient, find the gradient of the worst line of fit which goes through all the error bars and compare it to the gradient of the line of best fit.
$$
percentage\, uncertainty = \frac{best-worst}{best}\times 100
