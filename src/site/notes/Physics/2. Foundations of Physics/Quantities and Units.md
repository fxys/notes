##### Units
- **Physical quantities** can be measured and have a numerical value and a unit.
- **S.I. base units** can be used to derive all other units and the system was implemented to avoid errors in converting units:
	- Mass (kg)
	- Length (m)
	- Time (s)
	- Current (A)
	- Temperature (K)
	- Amount of Substance (mol)
- The **homogeneity** of physical equations can be checked using S.I. base units to determine if the units on either side of the equation are equal.
- Prefixed indicate the order of magnitude of a quantity:

|**Prefix**|**Order of Magnitude**|   
|---|:---:|
|femto (f)|$10^{-15}$|
|pico (p)|$10^{-12}$|
|nano (n)|$10^{-9}$|
|micro ($\mu$)|$10^{-6}$|
|milli (m)|$10^{-3}$|
|centi (c)|$10^{-2}$|
|deci (d)|$10^{-1}$|
|kilo (k)|$10^{3}$|
|mega (M)|$10^{6}$|
|giga (G)|$10^{9}$|
|tear (T)|$10^{12}$|
|peta (P)|$10^{15}$|

##### Scalars and Vectors
- A scalar quantity only has a magnitude whereas a vector quantity has both a magnitude and a direction.
- **Resultant vectors** can be calculated from two perpendicular vectors using Pythagoras' theorem and trigonometry.
- A vector, $F$, can be resolved into two perpendicular components.

F_x = F\cos{\theta} \\
F_y = F\sin{\theta} 
\end{aligned}
